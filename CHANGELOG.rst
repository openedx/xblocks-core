Unreleased
**********

* Renamed pypi package and repo from ``xblocks-contrib`` to ``xblocks-core``.
* Restructured Python source into ``src/xblock_<name>/`` packages (one per XBlock); the shared
  XML helpers moved to ``src/xblocks_core.legacy_utils/``.
* Renamed Django app entry points ``xblocks_contrib_problem_capa`` → ``xblock_problem_capa`` and
  ``xblocks_contrib_discussion`` → ``xblock_discussion`` (consumers in edx-platform must update
  ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and any direct imports).
* Renamed Transifex resource slugs ``xblocks-contrib-<name>`` → ``xblocks-core-<name>``; the
  combined source ``django.po`` now lives at ``src/xblocks_core_locale/conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/``.
